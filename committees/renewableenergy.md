Since the industrial revolution, the world has become increasingly more energy-dependent. We hollowed out the deep earth to attain coal and oil in order to grasp industrial might. Yet, as we progressed farther into the Anthropocene, our dear mother earth has become increasingly unstable environmentally, and geologically. It was only in the past century that humanity recognized the need for humanity to transition from non-renewable energy to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and perhaps nuclear. This exclusive middle school committee will explore how we as a global community can make this transition without adverse changes to our economies and cultures. It is up to each and every delegate to put their best plans forward to help facilitate this important change from a problematic today to a better tomorrow. We stand at a turning point as a generation. Failure in addressing this issue will result in nothing less than the ruins of civilizations, mass migrations, and famine. Success means surviving the defining crisis of our time and bringing humanity together into a brighter future.
