This crisis committee will deal with the domestic and international economic, public health and safety, and political ramifications of a highly infectious, severe, and deadly strain of H5N1 avian flu that begins to spread throughout the poultry of the United States. As the virus spreads, the members of this committee will be tasked with slowing the spread of the virus, monitoring the decline of the domestic fowl population, and preventing an economic collapse as poultry becomes an unsustainable source of sustenance. The virus could also spread to humans. If it did, how dangerous would it be? Could the avian flu become a global pandemic on par with that of COVID-19? In this crisis committee, these hypotheticals will be put to the test, and delegates will be tasked with finding creative solutions to prevent the outbreak from spiraling into an unstoppable worldwide pandemic.
