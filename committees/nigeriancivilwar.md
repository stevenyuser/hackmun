With a convoluted web of political maneuverings, economic turbulence, and humanitarian crises, the Nigerian Civil War is quite possibly the most significant event in Nigerian history. This period has far-reaching implications for the stability of the Nigerian region, broader geopolitical landscape, and well-being of the Nigerian and Biafran people. Delegates will embody key figures to discuss possible resolutions for the conflict while securing personal interests. Additionally, they must answer important questions such as what ramifications may result from the acknowledgment of Biafra as an independent state, how to address the humanitarian crisis, and how to obtain their constituencyâ€™s objectives for the war.
