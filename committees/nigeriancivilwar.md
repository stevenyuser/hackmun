The United States’s national debt recently surpassed $31.5 trillion, or over 135% of U.S. GDP. A default on this debt has never occurred but in recent months has been threatened in Congress and has been used as a bargaining chip in negotiations. But what if a default did occur? This crisis committee will deal with both the domestic and international economic, political, and military ramifications of the United States defaulting on its debt. As the effects of the default begin to compound, you, as members of President Joe Biden’s Cabinet, will be tasked with ensuring that the United States remains in its position of global economic, political, and military dominance, to the extent that it is possible.
