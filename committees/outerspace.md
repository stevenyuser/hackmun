We will discuss the sovereignty of space and planets such as Mars. In doing so, we will debate economic, political, and military guidelines for the countries conducting operations. We will consider how countries can use space fairly for economic benefit (mining, natural resources, trade routes), divide up space politically, develop international law and revise the Outer Space Treaty, and set rules regarding military and nuclear affairs and weapons of mass destruction to keep space peaceful for centuries to come.
